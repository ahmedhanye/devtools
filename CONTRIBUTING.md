# Contributing to DevTools

DevTools is a developer tooling monorepo providing utilities and workflows across CLI, daemon, API, and frontend interfaces.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.4.2 or higher
- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) 2.60.0 or higher
- Git 2.40.0 or higher

### Local setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedHanye/devtools.git
   cd devtools
   ```
2. Install dependencies and set up git hooks:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

## Development commands

Run checks across the monorepo during development:

- **Lint and format checks:**
  ```bash
  bun run check
  ```
- **Typecheck all workspaces:**
  ```bash
  bun run typecheck
  ```
- **Run test suites:**
  ```bash
  bun run test
  ```
- **Fast local verification:**
  ```bash
  bun run verify:fast
  ```
- **Canonical local verification (on-demand):**
  ```bash
  bun run verify
  ```

## Contribution workflow

1. **Start with an issue:** Every pull request links to an open tracking issue. Create a linked working branch:
   ```bash
   gh issue develop <ticket_number> --checkout
   ```
2. **Commit changes:** Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`<type>(<scope>): <description>`). Types `feat:` and `fix:` trigger automated semantic releases. Keep issue references in pull request descriptions rather than commit subjects.
3. **Stage atomic changes:** Stage specific files by path and inspect staged contents:
   ```bash
   git add <path>
   git diff --cached --stat
   ```
4. **Open a pull request:**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --assignee "@me" --fill
   ```
   Follow [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and ensure the description includes `Closes #<ticket_number>`. Inspect the linked issue and parent Spec descriptions (`gh issue view <ticket_number> --json number,title,body,state,labels` and `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<ticket_number>/parent`), updating any completed checklist tasks (`- [ ]` to `- [x]`) using `gh issue edit`.
5. **Push changes and resolve review comments:** Follow [Pushing changes and review synchronization](docs/contributing/push.md) to verify readiness, pause at git checkpoints, push commits, and resolve review threads post-push.
6. **Merge via squash merge:**
   ```bash
   gh pr merge <pr_number> --squash --delete-branch
   ```
